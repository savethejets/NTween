NTWeen

NTween is a facade layer between your Unity3D code 
and your tween engine.

Using NTween you can easily change out your tween 
engine if you need to and not have to alter all your code.

HOW TO USE

import the code into your unity3D project.

Depending on which tween engine you’re using you’ll need to add
a preprocessor directive for that engine.

Select from the menu Edit > Project Settings > Player 

Find the Box for “Scripting Define Symbols”

Enter HOTWEEN_TYPE if you’re using HOTWEEN
Enter DOTWEEN_TYPE if you’re using DOTWEEN.

NTween helper methods

NTween has some extension methods that will help you create clean code

ex.   transform.TweenPosition(new Vector3(1,1,1), 0.5f);
(this call transforms the position to 1,1,1 in 0.5f seconds) 

Check them out in the class NTweenHelper there’s a couple of helper methods in there.

If the thing you’re tweening isn’t a Transform or a SpriteRenderer you can manually create 
the tween

var builder = new NTweenBuilder (_sprite, 0.1f, "dimensions", OpenDimension);

NTween.Instance.CreateTween (builder); 

You can also attach Attributes to the tweens such as Delay, etc with the NTweenAttribute class.
